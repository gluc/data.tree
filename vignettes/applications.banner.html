While preparing this example, I asked my nine-year-old daughter, "Ana√Øs, imagine you have a basket full of mushrooms. How would you go about finding out which ones are poisonous?"
<br>"Dad, why would I want to know?" she replies, rolling her eyes. "No matter if they are poisonous or not, they are <i>dis-gust-ing</i>."
<br>"OK, fair enough", I sigh, "wrong daughter." 
<br>"Naomi", I turn to my seven year old, "how could you find out if a mushroom is poisonous?" 
<br>"Well", she says. "I'd just eat it. If I die, it's poisonous." 
<br>"But, come on, there must be a better way! Think, please!"
<br>"Think? Can't you see that I'm <i>playing</i>? Ask mom if you must!" She groans. So do I.
<br>"Mushrooms? Where did you buy them?" my wife asks. 
<br>"Good question, but - ... - it doesn't matter." 
<br>"No Sir, it <i>does</i> matter!"
<br>"Why?" I ask dubiously.
<br>"I'd have to to know if they are <i>organic</i>, obviously."
<br>Obviously. I play along, "Well, whatever, assume I found them in the forest, so they are all organic."
<br>"Aha!", she says triumphantly. "Then it's easy! If they are organic, they simply <i>must</i> be good for you. Hence, they <i>cannot</i> be poisonous!"
